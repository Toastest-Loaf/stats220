## A little about me:

- I am **undertaking** a degree in:
  1. *Computer Science*
  2. *Applied Statistics*.
- I am **taking** STATS 220 because:
  1. *I want to know as much as possible about using R*.
- I am **interested** in learning about:
  1. *using programs to model and understand statistics*.
