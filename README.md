# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science and Applied Statistics.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to know as much as possible about using R.
- I am interested in learning about using programs to model and understand statistics.
