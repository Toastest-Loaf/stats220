This is my repo for STATS 220. 

## A little about me:

- I am **undertaking** a degree in:
  1. [Computer Science](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/find-a-study-option/computer-science/undergraduate/bsc-compsci-from-2019.html)
  2. [Applied Statistics](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/find-a-study-option/statistics/undergraduate/bsc-from-2019/applied-statistics.html)
- I am **taking** [STATS 220](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1213) because:
  1. *I want to know as much as possible about using R*.
- I am **interested** in learning about:
  1. *using programs to model and understand statistics*.
